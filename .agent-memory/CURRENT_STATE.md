# FolderMate Current State

## Current implementation state
The repository is a Windows-oriented file organization platform with a working monorepo structure.

Major implementation areas are present:
- file ingestion and organization pipeline in the engine
- SQLite persistence and FTS5 indexing
- rules/classification/versioning/review subsystems
- IPC-based communication between engine and desktop UI
- Electron desktop shell and React renderer
- Windows folder customization and CorelDRAW adapter integration

## Completed major functionality
- Engine bootstrap and runtime orchestration exist.
- Repository and database abstractions are in place.
- Classification pipeline, versioning, and review queue logic exist.
- IPC auth handshake and RPC dispatch are implemented.
- Desktop shell and renderer infrastructure are present.
- Multi-step Onboarding, Free Community Tasks Key Generator, and Supporter VIP Activation system implemented.
- Documentation and ADRs are included in the repo.

## Work in progress / active risks
- Platform-specific Windows behavior still requires real Windows validation.
- CorelDRAW integration is not fully verifiable in a non-CorelDRAW environment.
- Runtime startup and environment assumptions may differ across user machines.

## Current priorities
- Preserve architecture and repo conventions.
- Keep the memory system synchronized with actual implementation.
- Use minimal, targeted changes for future work.
- Maintain a polished, branded desktop shell consistent with the FolderMate identity.

## Recent important changes
- Initial bootstrap documentation and persistent project memory system were created.
- Added the branded desktop shell assets, theme palette, and app icon/favicons for the production-ready app identity.
- Built the interactive Onboarding Wizard with Free Community Tasks (Star repo, comment on blog, follow LinkedIn/X), offline cryptographic key validation, and Supporter/Sponsor lifetime VIP key portals.
